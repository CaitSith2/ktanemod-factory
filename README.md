# Factory - a KTaNEModKit Mod

This mod provides a gameplay room resembling a factory-style production line for the defusing of bombs in a sequential manner, differing from the current style of multiple bombs gameplay whereby all bombs would start and should be defused simultaneously.

## This is a Work In Progress Mod!

As it stands, this mod is under large development, and functionality can and will change drastically between version releases to Steam and/or here. Expect there to be teething problems while under development.

## But why is it already released? Why not develop it fully before releasing it?

Mainly because the released functionality is already the main premise of the gameplay room, and I wanted to ensure that the main premise works and that people would be interested in it before continuing further development. I don't want to have to use the term _'Early Access'_ or _'Alpha Release'_, but in essence, that's what this mod is currently.

## I have ideas!

Cool! If you've got an idea for how the factory room should be styled/themed, and/or any cool ideas for easter eggs in the room (I do love adding easter eggs to things!), then head on to the [issues page](https://github.com/ashbash1987/ktanemod-factory/issues) and create an issue there with your idea.

## I have bugs!

Not so cool, but anticipated! Please post them to the [issues page](https://github.com/ashbash1987/ktanemod-factory/issues), including any steps to reproduce, platform you're playing on, and any log files if necessary.

## I have pull requests for things!

I might accept pull requests for small bug fixes, but for major functionality, I'd at least like to know about it first before you just submit pull requests. Don't go wasting your time on something that I might already be working on!
